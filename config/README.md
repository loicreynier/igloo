# Raw configuration files

Sometimes configurations files do not benefit from being generated by Nix/Home Manager
and can be simply imported.
When working on complex configurations it's also easier to get the full IDE experience
rather than working in Nix multiline strings.

These configurations files do not contain Nix expressions and can be imported in non-Nix systems.

- [`atuin`](./atuin): mostly Atuin default config
- [`bash`](./bash):
  - [`.bashrc`](./bash/.bashrc):
    minimal Bash configuration for non-Nix systems.
  - [`functions`](./bash/functions):
    Bash functions (with associated keybinding), should be imported by `.bashrc`
- [`bat`](./bat):
  default `bat` CLI arguments (different files for different themes/styles)
- [`direnv`](./direnv):
  `direnv` configuration with cache in `~/.cache/direnv/layouts` and daemonization
- [`editorconfig`](./editorconfig):
  EditorConfig with rules for all files I work with outside of repos
- [`glazewm`](./glazewm): mostly GlazeWM default config
- [`ipython`](./ipython): IPython shell configuration with autoreload and `fzf` history search
- [`powershell`](./powershell): Cross-platform PowerShell 7+ config
  with zoxide, Starship and fzf features and automatic profile update
- [`powertoys`](./powertoys): Windows PowerToys configuration with a lot of disabled modules
- [`python`](./python): Python shell configuration
  with history in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/python_history`
  and auto-import modules from `$PYTHONMODULES`
- [`readline`](./readline): GNU Readline configuration (for Bash) with some completion tweaks
- [`ripgrep`](./ripgrep): default `rg` CLI arguments
- [`sh`](./sh): minimal shell profile for non-Nix systems
- [`starship`](./starship): mostly Starship default config, just a little more verbose
- [`windowsterminal`](./windowsterminal): Windows Terminal keybindings, profiles and color schemes
